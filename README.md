# C-Lang
C Language learning and practice

This repo is the collection of practice programs which I created for learning C and Data Structures with C.

## Folders
**Programs**: This folder contains the C Programs.

**Data Structures**: This folder contains the Data Structures implementations.  
Every Data Structure is in a separate directory with a Makefile and `test.c` which contains the tests.  
For compiling and executing the implementations,  
    - `make all` : to compiling everything  
    - `make run` : to exectue the tests.  

# Credits
These were mainly from James Aspnes' Notes on Data Structures and Programming Techniques. [Link](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html).
